<h1> Rice</h1>

<p> Choosing the perfect variety of rice is of the utmost importance. You can either go for the traditional Basmati or some of the local gems like Zeera Samba, Golden Sela, Kaima, Jeerakashala and Kala Bhaat. South India often cooks up its Biryanis using some of the local varieties of rice that render distinct taste, texture and aroma to the dish.</p>

<h2> Meat and Veggies</h2>
<p> Your vegetables should be garden fresh and cooked separately while meat should be of the finest quality. Fish, prawns and vegetables take lesser time to cook over big chicken chunks or meat pieces. The cooking time therefore depends a lot on the ingredients used. When cooking with meat/chicken, ensure using small, soft tender portions to facilitate quicker cooking. Meat/chicken should be marinated well before cooking with rice.</p>
